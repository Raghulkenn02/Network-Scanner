A simple Python-based network scanner that identifies active hosts within a specified IP range by checking if port 80 (HTTP) is open. This tool is useful for basic reconnaissance and network monitoring.

- Scans an IP range in CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).
- Identifies active hosts by checking open HTTP ports (port 80).
- Simple and lightweight, using Python's built-in libraries.

 Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
